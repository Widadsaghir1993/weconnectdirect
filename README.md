SMM modified from OE
This has two directories
1. djangoenv ( which was created by executing froom shell 
              virtualenv djangoenv
              source djangoenv/bin/activate
              cd openeats
              pip install -r requirements.txt )
             
2. openeats ( this is the source tree for the openeats (which initially came from 
              https://blog.kuntzsch.me/setting-up-a-self-hosted-recipe-management-site-openeats )

you will have to know and understand django and python process to proceed here, suggest only the files
in openeats need to modified.
